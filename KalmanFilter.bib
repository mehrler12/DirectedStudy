  abstract = {Adaptive optics is a prime example of how progress in observational astronomy can be driven by technological developments. At many observatories it is now considered to be part of a standard instrumentation suite, enabling ground-based telescopes to reach the diffraction limit and, thus, providing spatial resolution superior to that achievable from space with current or planned satellites. In this review, we consider adaptive optics from the astrophysical perspective. We show that adaptive optics has led to important advances in our understanding of a multitude of astrophysical processes and describe how the requirements from science applications are now driving the development of the next generation of novel adaptive optics techniques.},

In each iteration of applying the Kalman filter, the two phases of predict and update contain a total of 18 matrix operations which include addition, subtraction, multiplication and inversion. As recent graphic processor units (GPU) have shown to provide high speedup in matrix operations, we implemented a GPU accelerated Kalman filter in this work. For general reference purposes, we tested the filter on typical large-scale over-determined systems with thousands of components in states and measurements. For the various combinations of configurations in our test, the GPU accelerated filter shows a scalable speedup as either the state or the measurement dimension increases. The obtained 2 to 3 orders of magnitude speedup over its single-threaded CPU counterpart shows a promising direction of using the GPU-based Kalman filter in large-scale time-critical applications.},

  abstract = {We build on a long-standing tradition in astronomical adaptive optics (AO) of specifying performance metrics and error budgets using linear systems modeling in the spatial-frequency domain. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive tool for the calculation of error budgets in terms of residual temporally filtered phase power spectral densities and variances. In addition, the fast simulation of AO-corrected point spread functions (PSFs) provided by this method can be used as inputs for simulations of science observations with next-generation instruments and telescopes, in particular to predict post-coronagraphic contrast improvements for planet finder systems. We extend the previous results and propose the synthesis of a distributed Kalman filter to mitigate both aniso-servo-lag and aliasing errors whilst minimizing the overall residual variance. We discuss applications to (i) analytic AO-corrected PSF modeling in the spatial-frequency domain, (ii) post-coronagraphic contrast enhancement, (iii) filter optimization for real-time wavefront reconstruction, and (iv) PSF reconstruction from system telemetry. Under perfect knowledge of wind velocities, we show that \${\textbackslash}sim\$60 nm rms error reduction can be achieved with the distributed Kalman filter embodying anti- aliasing reconstructors on 10 m class high-order AO systems, leading to contrast improvement factors of up to three orders of magnitude at few \$\{{\textbackslash}lambda\}/D\$ separations (\${\textbackslash}sim1-5\{{\textbackslash}lambda\}/D\$) for a 0 magnitude star and reaching close to one order of magnitude for a 12 magnitude star.},

This paper revisits minimum-variance (MV) control design for astronomical AO systems in a state-space framework. It presents a survey of the modeling and control issues arising in this multi-variable disturbance rejection problem. In a linear time-invariant framework, and under some mild assumptions, the optimal solution to MV control for AO systems is shown to be a discrete-time LQG controller. This result holds for a DM with instantaneous response, and for a fairly general class of DM‚Äôs dynamics. The state-space approach is extended to Wide-field Adaptive Optics (WfAO) configurations involving several DMs and/or WFSs. Integral-action control used in existing AO systems is compared with the LQG controller. Experimental WfAO results obtained on a laboratory test bench are presented, showing significant improvement in performance. Finally, open issues and perspectives of applicative and/or theoretical interests are discussed.},

  abstract = {Orbital debris in low Earth orbit (LEO) are now sufficiently dense that the use of LEO space is threatened by runaway collision cascading. A problem predicted more than thirty years ago, the threat from debris larger than about 1cm demands serious attention. A promising proposed solution uses a high power pulsed laser system on the Earth to make plasma jets on the objects, slowing them slightly, and causing them to re-enter and burn up in the atmosphere. In this paper, we reassess this approach in light of recent advances in low-cost, light-weight modular design for large mirrors, calculations of laser-induced orbit changes and in design of repetitive, multi-kilojoules lasers, that build on inertial fusion research. These advances now suggest that laser orbital debris removal (LODR) is the most cost-effective way to mitigate the debris problem. No other solutions have been proposed that address the whole problem of large and small debris. A LODR system will have multiple uses beyond debris removal. International cooperation will be essential for building and operating such a system.},

  abstract = {In a robustly adaptive Kalman filter, the key problem is to construct an adaptive factor to balance the contributions of the kinematic model information and the measurements on the state vector estimates, and the corresponding learning statistic for identifying the kinematic model biases. What we pursue in this paper are some optimal adaptive factors under the particular conditions that the state vector can or cannot be estimated by measurements. Two optimal adaptive factors are derived, one of which is deduced by requiring that the estimated covariance matrix of the predicted residual vector equals the corresponding theoretical one. The other is obtained by requiring that the estimated covariance matrix of the predicted state vector equals its theoretical one. The two related optimal adaptive factors are given. These are analyzed and compared in theory and in an actual example. This shows, through the actual computations, that the filtering results obtained by optimal adaptive factors are superior to those obtained by adaptive factors based on experience.},

  abstract = {A marine INS/GPS adaptive navigation system is presented. GPS with two antenna providing vessel's altitude is selected as the auxiliary system fusing with INS to improve the performance of the hybrid system. The Kalman filter is the most frequently used algorithm in the integrated navigation system, which is capable of estimating INS errors online based on the measured errors between INS and GPS. The standard Kalman filter (SKF) assumes that the statistics of the noise on each sensor are given. As long as the noise distributions do not change, the Kalman filter will give the optimal estimation. However GPS receiver will be disturbed easily and thus temporally changing measurement noise will join into the outputs of GPS, which will lead to performance degradation of the Kalman filter. Many researchers introduce fuzzy logic control method into innovation-based adaptive estimation adaptive Kalman filtering (IAE-AKF) algorithm, and accordingly propose various adaptive Kalman filters. However how to design the fuzzy logic controller is a very complicated problem still without a convincing solution. A novel IAE-AKF is proposed herein, which is based on the maximum likelihood criterion for the proper computation of the filter innovation covariance and hence of the filter gain. The approach is direct and simple without having to establish fuzzy inference rules. After having deduced the proposed IAE-AKF algorithm theoretically in detail, the approach is tested by the simulation based on the system error model of the developed INS/GPS integrated marine navigation system. Simulation results show that the adaptive Kalman filter outperforms the SKF with higher accuracy, robustness and less computation. It is demonstrated that this proposed approach is a valid solution for the unknown changing measurement noise exited in the Kalman filter.},

  abstract = {This article considers the application of variational Bayesian methods to joint recursive estimation of the dynamic state and the time-varying measurement noise parameters in linear state space models. The proposed adaptive Kalman filtering method is based on forming a separable variational approximation to the joint posterior distribution of states and noise parameters on each time step separately. The result is a recursive algorithm, where on each step the state is estimated with Kalman filter and the sufficient statistics of the noise variances are estimated with a fixed-point iteration. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated with simulated data.},

So the conventional Kalman filter exists limitation in MEMS-IMU/GPS integrated navigation. This paper presented the use of multiple model adaptive estimation(MMAE) where multiple Kalman filters were run in parallel using different dynamic or stochastic models in MEMS-IMU/GPS integrated navigation. And the modified multiple model Kalman filter was used in order to solve the limitation of multiple model adaptive estimation(MMAE). Using static tests, the algorithm designed was validated. The test results show that the modified multiple model Kalman filter can improve performance of MEMS-IMU/GPS integrated navigation system, compared to the conventional Kalman filtering algorithm. And using the designed algorithm, the positioning accuracy is better than 5m and velocity accuracy is better than 0.1m/ s2, and the attitude errors are less than 0.5 degrees on the static condition.},
