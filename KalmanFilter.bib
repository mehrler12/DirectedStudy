  abstract  = {For linear dynamic systems with hidden states, the Kalman filter can estimate the system state and its error covariance considering the uncertainties in transition and observation models. In each iteration of applying the Kalman filter, the two phases of predict and update contain a total of 18 matrix operations which include addition, subtraction, multiplication and inversion. As recent graphic processor units (GPU) have shown to provide high speedup in matrix operations, we implemented a GPU accelerated Kalman filter in this work. For general reference purposes, we tested the filter on typical large-scale over-determined systems with thousands of components in states and measurements. For the various combinations of configurations in our test, the GPU accelerated filter shows a scalable speedup as either the state or the measurement dimension increases. The obtained 2 to 3 orders of magnitude speedup over its single-threaded CPU counterpart shows a promising direction of using the GPU-based Kalman filter in large-scale time-critical applications.},

  abstract = {We build on a long-standing tradition in astronomical adaptive optics (AO) of specifying performance metrics and error budgets using linear systems modeling in the spatial-frequency domain. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive tool for the calculation of error budgets in terms of residual temporally filtered phase power spectral densities and variances. In addition, the fast simulation of AO-corrected point spread functions (PSFs) provided by this method can be used as inputs for simulations of science observations with next-generation instruments and telescopes, in particular to predict post-coronagraphic contrast improvements for planet finder systems. We extend the previous results and propose the synthesis of a distributed Kalman filter to mitigate both aniso-servo-lag and aliasing errors whilst minimizing the overall residual variance. We discuss applications to (i) analytic AO-corrected PSF modeling in the spatial-frequency domain, (ii) post-coronagraphic contrast enhancement, (iii) filter optimization for real-time wavefront reconstruction, and (iv) PSF reconstruction from system telemetry. Under perfect knowledge of wind velocities, we show that \${\textbackslash}sim\$60 nm rms error reduction can be achieved with the distributed Kalman filter embodying anti- aliasing reconstructors on 10 m class high-order AO systems, leading to contrast improvement factors of up to three orders of magnitude at few \$\{{\textbackslash}lambda\}/D\$ separations (\${\textbackslash}sim1-5\{{\textbackslash}lambda\}/D\$) for a 0 magnitude star and reaching close to one order of magnitude for a 12 magnitude star.},

This paper revisits minimum-variance (MV) control design for astronomical AO systems in a state-space framework. It presents a survey of the modeling and control issues arising in this multi-variable disturbance rejection problem. In a linear time-invariant framework, and under some mild assumptions, the optimal solution to MV control for AO systems is shown to be a discrete-time LQG controller. This result holds for a DM with instantaneous response, and for a fairly general class of DM‚Äôs dynamics. The state-space approach is extended to Wide-field Adaptive Optics (WfAO) configurations involving several DMs and/or WFSs. Integral-action control used in existing AO systems is compared with the LQG controller. Experimental WfAO results obtained on a laboratory test bench are presented, showing significant improvement in performance. Finally, open issues and perspectives of applicative and/or theoretical interests are discussed.},
