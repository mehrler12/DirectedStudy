# P-CuReD
This one seems pretty promising, they show it's parallezable and everything. There's also a variant of this called CuRed that could be worth looking into. The math is pretty complex and a bit over my head at this point so it's hard to assess whether it's well suited for a GPU. From what I've gathered it's mostly based on Fourier transforms which I know there's a cuda library for https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/9148/1/Fast-algorithm-for-wavefront-reconstruction-in-XAO-SCAO-with-pyramid/10.1117/12.2057375.full?SSO=1&tab=ArticleLink there's also this paper that goes into depth on the different reconstruction methods https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Astronomical-Telescopes-Instruments-and-Systems/volume-6/issue-01/010901/Review-on-methods-for-wavefront-reconstruction-from-pyramid-wavefront-sensor/10.1117/1.JATIS.6.1.010901.full?tab=ArticleLinkReference&SSO=1 
# DARC
This one is a similar algorithm based on matrix multiplication and stuff like that, they have a full GPU implementiation that's outlined in the paper. They do say it doesn't perform well on multiple GPUs so the project here would be optimizing that. The con of this one is I have no idea if that's possible. https://escholarship.org/content/qt6809n74d/qt6809n74d.pdf?t=oezrmh
# Lasers
This one I'm personally most excited about. However I have yet to find a paper that's a good jumping off point, anything I've found kind of just says "x will be computed" and doesn't really go into algorithms at all. The closest i've found is some papers that talk about getting orbital predictions with lasers to use for targetting. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273117712001020
