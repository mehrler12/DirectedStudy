# GPU Suitability of Adaptive Kalman Filters
## Introduction
Earth based telescopes often have to contend with conducting observations through atmospheric turbulence. An interesting binary star system may just look like a smudge with distortion from the atmosphere. Until the 90s the most feasible way to combat turbulence from the atmosphere was to put your telescope in space like Hubble or TESS. The sheer cost of putting your telescope in space is massive and there is only so much room in optimal orbits in space. Adaptive optics allows ground based telescopes to compensate for atmospheric distortion and achieve much higher resolutions. This lets us build massive telescopes on Earth that can observe the far reaches of space or potentially even image exoplanets. 

An adaptive optics system has several parts, a Wavefront Sensor (WFS), a control system, a Deformable Mirror (DM), and potentially one or more Laser Guide Stars (LGS). The WFS takes an image of a bright reference star (can be either a Natural Guide Star (NGS) or LGS) and sends data about the wavefront it received to the control system. The control system takes that data and compares it to how the NGS or LGS is supposed to look and figures out what shape the DM needs to be to make the image how it is supposed to look. The DM is a large mirror made up of a bunch of smaller pieces that can move around incredibly quickly, thus changing the shape of the whole mirror. Given the precision required for getting accurate images and fast changing nature of the atmosphere the control system needs to make its calculations incredibly quickly. 

The most time consuming step is taking the data coming from the WFS and reconstructing the waveform from it. A common method to do this is through an algorithm called Matrix Vector Multiply (MVM) which has O(n^2) time complexity with n being the size of the telescope. As we are building larger and larger telescopes (Thirty Meter Telescope, or the aptly named Extremely Large Telescope) this O(n^2) time complexity will no longer do. There are a large number of algorithms out there but one of particular interest is the Kalman Filter, it has O(n log n) time complexity and provides great accuracy in it's wavefront reconstructions. It also has the added benefit of being able to predict a step ahead fairly accurately. The Kalman filter is also well suited for parallelization on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).

A downside of using the Kalman filter is that you need good knowledge of the atmospheric conditions for it to work optimally, if the atmospheric conditions change the accuracy of the filter lowers significantly. An interesting proposed extension of the Kalman filter is the Adaptive Kalman Filter. This allows the algorithm to slightly adjust the matrices that represent the processes like wind speed to better compensate for changing conditions.

This extension to the Kalman Filter leads us to the research question that will be addressed by this report. *Does making the Kalman Filter adaptive add complexity that no longer makes it efficient to parallelize on a GPU?*. Answering this question is important as it can tell us whether a wavefront reconstruction method based on Adaptive Kalman Filtering can be implemented on a GPU or whether another approach is required. It is also potentially useful in more than just large telescopes, adaptive optics is also used to image human eyes or to correct for atmospheric distortion in lasers shot into space for either satellite communication or removal of space debris.
